Innes IV ([primehalo](http://www.absoluteanime.com/admin/mods.htm))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Adds a drop-down selector to the header, which detects a selection change and triggers a board style change through the UCP.\r\n- Automatically redirects back to the original page being viewed after style has changed.\r\n- Works for guests too, but uses a special cookie instead.\r\n- ACP module to set guest access and whether to use the default template location: `EVENT overall_header_navigation_prepend`\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n- >= phpBB 3.1-dev\r\n- >= PHP 5.3\r\n\r\n#### Languages supported\r\n- English\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\n#### To do list\r\n- Choose a better template event to include it in the header. The current position is not ideal. Especially for responsive layout.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nYou can install this on the latest copy of the develop branch (phpBB 3.1-dev) by following the steps below.\r\n\r\n**Manual:**\r\n\r\n1. If there is not yet an `./ext/paybas/quickstyle/` folder tree starting from your board root, create one.\r\n2. Copy the entire contents of this repo into that folder you just created (You can leave out the *.md files, screenshot.png, .gitignore, and the .git folder).\r\n3. Go to `ACP -> Customise -> Manage extensions -> Extensions`\r\n4. Click Enable.\r\n\r\n**Git:**\r\n\r\n1. From the board root run the following git command:\r\n`git clone https://github.com/paybas/QuickStyle.git ext/paybas/quickstyle`\r\n2. Go to `ACP -> Customise -> Manage extensions -> Extensions`\r\n3. Click Enable.\r\n\r\n## Uninstallation\r\nIn the ACP -> Customise -> Manage Extensions -> Extensions module, you can click one of the following:\r\n- **Disable:** This keeps the Extension data and schema intact but prevents it from running. The whole thing kinda falls apart. The administration area will be unavailable. When you re-enable the extension, all functionality will become active again.\r\n- **Delete data:** This destroys any data added by the extension, and reverts any schema changes it made. You can re-enable the extension, but all the settings of this extension will be gone.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n[GNU General Public License v2](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0)\r\n\r\nÂ© 2014 - PayBas","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
